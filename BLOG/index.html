    <h1><em>Hello World</em></h1>
    <p><strong>My Experience with Skill Distillery</strong></p>
    </p>Firstyl, I would like to thank everyone for the assistance and guidance with beginning this course as well as a new career path. The beginning with Skill Distillery has been a challenge, being away form any sort of coding for more than 5 years! But with the way the program is layed out and set up so anyone can get into it/back into it is very amazing.</p>
  <p>It is very exciting to be starting a new career. Previously Ive decided to pursue a culinary career. With it being a very stressful industry, I've slowly found my way back into technology. My previous degree is an Associates of Applied Arts in Audio Engineering from <em> The Los Angeles Film School.</em> I have a passion for music. Or creating in general, but just as the culinary world. The music industry is aso very difficult. With all of that being said. I've chosen coding and this program not as a back up plan, but as a way to enrich my eagerness for learning.</p>
